Focus on new habbit text field on add habbit button click
Add animation on add habbit button click
add habbit text existance check
Add paddinds for modal on mobile
dont use resetedHabbits.forEach(habbit => updateHabit(habbit)); create update all habbits method
"Updated habbit" is in console output when habbit is 5/5 and i click to check mark instead of plus button
add + and - buttons for mobile number input
adjust no habbits state look (maybe add no habbits text)
adjust animations 
use functions like updateHabitNeedCount instead of modifying todaySnapshots
populateSpreadsheetWithHabits calls to many times
on clearing spreadsheet don't call extra get spreadsheet. Do delete immediately
use fetch instead of axios bcs i mostly use fetch

highlight "Hello" on welcome screen

instead of registerSyncFunction(() => manualSyncToSpreadsheet(newAccessToken)); use autorefresh access token if needed
dont search for spreadsheet always but store streadsheet id
let it be that under the hood eact google query gets access token from local storage and refreshs it if needed
and eact google query stores pagesheet id
mode google api functions to separate file
read about hydration

bug: there is a habit in spreadsheet with was some states like 0/1 
2/3 by days. Then there is an empty space for future days, them state 
like 1/3 again. When we create habit new column will be appended on 
the right. And that new column will take that 1/3 which was after space.

after one hour token expires and sync stops working

!! USEGOOGLESHEETS still uses localStorage api

direct google spreadsheet changes in runtime are not handled:
when I change data in spreadsheet in runtime and then I change 
something in habits some old data from local state pushes to google
seen when i delete column in google but there was habit in local storage

set current date in useEffect and then filter habits for today habits render
handle case when Habits column or Notes column is deleted

PLAN HABITS and notes: I any column is filled already, consider it

Use Redux
Use memo for habbit button to not repaint all habbit buttons on habbit increase counter button click
add tests (unit and e2e)
test parse from google spreadsheet to habits and snapshots function
Use css modules / styled components
Use react lists
create type for date
consider alternatives for fetch: https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#what-are-good-alternatives-to-data-fetching-in-effects
consider RTK Query (TanStack Query) or SWR

use useExternalStore for local storage data maybe
or maybe in state set today state variable so that now render will be pure but so i need to reimplement api so that it accepts date as argument
or maybe in effect get habits from api
